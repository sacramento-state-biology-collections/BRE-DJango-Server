## Background:

---

The California State University of Sacramento's Biology Department has ~7000 collections and they want a way to manage them digitally. They asked us to create an easily accessible and reliable database software that would allow both faculty members and students of the school to edit or review the university's data collections, laboratories, and museums.

## Solution:

---

We will create a website where users can search through the databases and the faculty can sign in and modify the collection data. It will be a progressive web app (PWA), which means the website can be downloaded by anyone and use it offline.

## Prototypes:

## Timeline:

---

Sprint 0-Project Preparation: Our team created meeting times based on each other's schedules. We met with our client to discuss project requirements and to fill out the project proposal. Acquired the mammals database from the client.

Sprint 1: We set up our Jira and Github accounts. We practiced using jira and making git commits. We began coming up with user stories for the next sprint.

Sprint 2: We started discussing how to implement indexdb and service workers as well as clean the database. We made mockups.

Sprint 3: We completed our MVP. We began implementing the service worker.

Sprint 4: We created the mockups for the login page and admin page. We began moving BRE to a server.

Future:

Sprint 5: Part 1 of CRUD implimentation
Begin implimenting the additional features to make the application match the CRUD functionality requirements. Currently we are able to search, but this upcoming semester we are going to add the ability to create, update, and delete data and tables. Add the mock ups to the website and make them semi functional.

Sprint 6: Finalize and enable everything to make the site match CRUD functionality.

Sprint 7: Add security systems and verification for users so that only authorized personnel have the ability to edit the data.

Sprint 8: Add pictures on top of the systems in place to support images of specimens. This means that we need to be able to CRUD images and store them as well as implement the optional download of images.

Sprint 9: Make documentation for the technologies we used so we can give this project to the biology department and they can understand how it all works.
